LwM2M server with HTTP REST API example application.

The REST API is based on [MBED Device Connector API documentation](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-device-connector-web-interfaces/en/latest/api-reference/) and main functionality should be compatible, however differences should be expected.
Until separate documentation is available, please refer to code for details.

The code in this directory is licensed under the MIT license, however please note that the application uses other libraries (including wakaama) that come under different licenses.
